				<h2>The Wizard of Oz</h2>
				<p>The Wizard of Oz is a 1939 American musical fantasy comedy-drama film produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and the best-known and most commercially successful adaptation based on the 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum.[4] It stars Judy Garland as Dorothy Gale. The costars are Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Bert Lahr, Frank Morgan, Billie Burke, and Margaret Hamilton, with Charley Grapewin, Pat Walshe and Clara Blandick, Terry (billed as Toto), and the Singer Midgets as the Munchkins.</p>
				<p>Notable for its use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score, and unusual characters, over the years it has become an icon of American popular culture. It was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, but lost to Gone with the Wind. It did win in two other categories, including Best Original Song for "Over the Rainbow" and Best Original Score by Herbert Stothart. However, the film was a box office disappointment on its initial release, earning only $3,017,000 on a $2,777,000 budget, despite receiving largely positive reviews.[2][6] It was MGM's most expensive production to date and did not completely recoup the studio's investment nor turn a profit until theatrical re-releases starting in 1949.[7]</p>

					<h3>The Story</h3>
					<p>Back at the Emerald City, the Wizard delays granting their requests. Toto pulls back a curtain and exposes the "Wizard" as a normal middle-aged man who has been projecting the fearsome image; he denies Dorothy's accusation that he is a bad man, but admits to being a humbug. He then gives the Scarecrow a diploma, the Lion a medal, and the Tin Man a ticking heart-shaped watch, making them realize that they had what they wanted all along. They just did not know it yet. He then prepares to launch his hot air balloon to take Dorothy home but Toto runs off, and as she tries to get him back, the balloon leaves without them. Suddenly, Glinda returns and tells her that she can still return home by using the ruby slippers. After sharing a tearful farewell with her friends, she follows Glinda's instructions and taps her heels together three times and repeats, "There's no place like home". She wakes up in bed at her home in Kansas, surrounded by her family, the farmhands, Professor Marvel, and Toto. Though they dismiss her adventure as a dream, she insists that it was all real, and that there is no place like home.</p>

					<h3>The Writing of the Movie</h3>
					<p>
						<pre>
	<br> So anyhow, Yip also wrote all the dialogue in that time and the setup <br> to the songs and he also wrote the part where they give out the heart, <br> the brains, and the nerve, because he was the final script editor.
